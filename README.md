# Vite Exercise

## Creating a Hello World React Application using Vite üëã

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, we will practice creating React applications using Vite. ‚ö°Ô∏è

Your task will be to create and clean a new project setup to display a simple "Hello, World!" message using React and Vite. This exercise is designed to familiarize you with the process of setting up a React project using Vite as a build tool, giving you a quick start into the world of modern web development.

## Tasks üìã

- Open your terminal.
- Run `npm create vite@latest` to start creating a new project with Vite.
- Create a new project named `hello-world` by following the prompts. Select `React` when asked for a framework and `JavaScript` when asked for a variant.
- Navigate into your project directory with `cd hello-world`.
- Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Run the project using `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Explore the project structure created by Vite. Convert it to an empty "Hello, World!" application by cleaning it up. Remove all non-mandatory files and content. You can keep the styling files by clearing them up, but ensure the main content of your app displays "Hello, World!" in the browser.

## Clean-up Guide üßπ

- **Remove** Unnecessary boilerplate files that Vite's React template generates.
- **Modify**: The `App.js` file to include only the necessary code to render the "Hello, World!" text. Additionally, clean up the style files to match the simplicity of your "Hello, World!" application, removing any styles that are not used.
- **Retain**: Any configuration files you feel are necessary for the exercise, but ensure they don't interfere with the simplicity of the "Hello, World!" application.

Happy coding!
